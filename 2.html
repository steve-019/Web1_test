<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">CSS</a>, or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as <strong>HTML</strong>. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>

<p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

<p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>
