<h2>WEB</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">The WEB</a>, The World Wide Web (WWW), is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by <strong>URL</strong>(Uniform Resource Locator, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the Web are transferred via <strong>HTTP</strong>(the Hypertext Transfer Protocol), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.</p>

<p>English scientist Sir Timothy Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age, and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.</p>

<p>Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in <strong>HTML</strong>.Special HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs which permits users to navigate to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain references to images, video, audio, and software components which are either displayed or  internally executed in the user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content.</p>
