<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">HTML</a>, or The HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> and scripting languages such as <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. <strong>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</strong>, former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>
